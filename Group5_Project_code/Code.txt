Steps to execute the code:
1. There are no external dependencies or libraries used to implement our project.
2. So, we can execute it directly like a normal C language code.
3. We have used threads to implement our project. So, while executing we just need to add -pthread.
4. gcc -o project project.c -pthread.
5. We get an executable file.
6. Just run that executable file and we can have our project up and running.
